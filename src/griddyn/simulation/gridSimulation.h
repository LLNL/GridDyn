/** @brief Grid simulation object
 GridSimulation is a base simulation class its intention is to handle some of the basic
simulation bookkeeping tasks that would be common to all simulations in GridDyn including things like
logging, errors,  recording, and a few other topics.  Doesn't really do anything much as far as simulating goes
the class isn't abstract but it is intended to be built upon for more usable simulation objects
