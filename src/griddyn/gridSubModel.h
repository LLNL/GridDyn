/** @brief base class for any model can act as a component of another model
* gridSubModel class defines the interface for models which can act as components of other models such as Exciter,
or Governor most of the differential equations are contained in submodels.  The interface is meant to be flexible
so unlike gridSecondary models there is no predefined interface, but at the same time many of the function calls
are intended to be the same,  The main difference being there is only one initialize function, they can operate in
power flow but those objects just call initialize twice
