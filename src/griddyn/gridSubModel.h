/** @brief base class for any model can act as a component of another model
* gridSubModel class defines the interface for models which can act as components of other models
such as Exciter, or Governor most of the differential equations are contained in submodels.  The
interface is meant to be flexible so unlike gridSecondary models there is no predefined interface,
but at the same time many of the function calls are intended to be the same,  The main difference
being there is only one initialize function, they can operate in power flow but those objects just
call initialize twice
