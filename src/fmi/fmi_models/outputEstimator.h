The output may not be a state variable in these contexts the FMI itself doesn't always stay updated in intermediate time values
Thus the output may need to be estimated for use in the rest of the system.  The estimate is done by using the Jacobian values for the output
from both the input and states and summing them with the actual difference between the last known value
