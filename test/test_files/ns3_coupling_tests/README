geco_fault_coupled.xml         - GridDyn XML file for the transmission system
ieee39_relays_geco_coupled.csv - Describes a few GridDyn relays for the
                                 IEEE 39-bus system

Unfortunately, the format for the relay CSV file(s) is currently not
well-documented.

For ieee39_relays_geco_coupled.csv, a few relays have been set up based on
templates described in geco_fault_coupled.xml. Only the relays in this
CSV file will be present during the GridDyn simulation. Here's an explanation
of the contents of ieee39_relays_geco_coupled.csv, on a line-by-line basis:

9,2,auto_2,3_4,LINK#5   - This line represents the relay on the transmission
                          line between buses 3 and 4, closest to bus 3.
10,2,auto_2,t2,LINK#5   - This line represents the relay on the transmission
                          line between buses 3 and 4, closest to bus 4.
13,2,auto_2,t1,LINK#7   - This line represents the relay on the transmission
                          line between buses 4 and 5, closest to bus 4.
14,2,auto_2,5_4,LINK#7  - This line represents the relay on the transmission
                          line between buses 4 and 5, closest to bus 5.
16,2,auto_2,14_4,LINK#8 - This line represents the relay on the transmission
                          line between buses 4 and 14, closest to bus 14.
