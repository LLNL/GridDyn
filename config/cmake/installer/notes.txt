Notes:
x will need to add some dlls (not yet in public repo), possibly library of other files
- may add GUI later, at which point we would include a start menu option for the exe to gui version
x need note somewhere for KLU license
x see if you can wait to request admin privileges after clicking install or
  not requiring admin privileges at all
x doxygen documentation system (html documentation)
	- can build doxy config file in cmake
x sync version numbers with those in CMakeLists
x read about cross-OS installer options (alternatives to NSIS)

To do:
x read CES-21 confluence stuff
x integrating tests into CTest functionality
      [Note: could use CDash to create HTML pages of test results, but would
       need to either use CDash servers or have a private server to maintain.]
- build travisCI test integration for public repo (continuous build system for repo)
    - would need CTest working first
    - checks test exe files before adding
- learn about functional mockup interface (FMI) -- other intern will be building library
    - modeling and simulation tool
- look in to test directory referencing issue
