# - Find FSKIT library.
#
# This module finds if Fskit is installed and determines where the
# include files and libraries are.  This code sets the following variables:
#  FSKIT_FOUND         = Fskit was found
#  FSKIT_LIBRARY_DIR   = path to where libraries can be found
#  FSKIT_INCLUDE_DIR   = path to where header files can be found
#  FSKIT_LIBRARIES     = link libraries for Fskit
